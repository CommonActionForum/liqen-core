## Ask a Question

When asking a question, it is required to include the **expected answer**, like a fill-the-gap question. This ensures that every answer give relevant data to the question.

There are questions in which this might be obvious. If the question is *Who is the writer of El Quijote?*, the only valid answer is «Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra».

But often the question is much more complex. If the question is *How does the climate changes in the last 10 years?*, some valid answers can be «mean temperature in 2016 was 30 degrees», «it rains 40 days less in 2016 than in 1996» or «dessert area has grown a 30%».

To solve the second problem, the question must be paired with the **expected answer**. For example, *«mean temperature in 2016», «mean temperature in 1996» and «place»* (three concepts). Then, these can be valid answers:

| Mean temperature in 2016 | Mean temperature in 1996 | Place
| :----------------------- | :----------------------- | :----
| 23 degrees               | 18 degrees               | World
| 13 degrees               | 12 degrees               | Greenland

The person who makes the question must state the expected answer as precise as possible to get relevant answers.
