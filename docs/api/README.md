# API Reference

This documentation is intended to get you up-and-running with the Liqen APIs. We'll cover everything you need to know, from authentication, to manipulating results, to combining results with other services.

## Schema

All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed through `https://liqen-core.herokuapp.com`. All data is sent and received as **JSON**. Make sure to specify the `Content-type: application/json` header.

## Clients

We are currently developing an Official Liqen Client for JavaScript. It converts the JSON responses into JavaScript objects.

## Other content types

In a short-term future, it is planned to allow two more content types:

- HTML
- JSON-LD
