# Documentation in progress :construction: :construction:

The documentation is now being constructed. We are migrating from https://exacs.github.io/liqen-docs to this repository.

Help us by translating and completing all the `.md` documents.

If you write a commit changing only documentation, please include `[ci skip]` in the commit body. This way, the automatic tests are not passed.
