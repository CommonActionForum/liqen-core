# Liqen Core

This is the Core of the Liqen Project, the Wikipedia of Facts.

We offer you a couple of ways to install and deploy this application.

## One-click Heroku deployment

You can use the following button to deploy the App in Heroku.

It will install and setup everything for you, i.e.:

- A PostgreSQL Database (free Tier)
- Elixir and Phoenix build stacks
- Procfile
- Autogenerated secure secret keys

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

When prompted, set the environmental variable `APP_URL_HOST` with the URL of your app (without the https part). Set it your own custom domain name or the heroku apps domain name.

This means that, if you are planning to use a `herokuapp.com` domain, you should choose your App name. For example if your app name is `my-app`, the generated URL will be `https://my-app.herokuapp.com` and you have to set the variable with the value: `my-app.herokuapp.com`.

## Install locally in your machine

To run this application you need to download

- [PostgreSQL](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides) 9.4 or higher.
- [Phoenix Framework](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/installation) and its dependencies, including Elixir and Erlang.

Then, to start the app (in development mode)

* Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
* Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
* Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Deploy in non-heroku environments

Please [check the Phoenix deployment guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).
